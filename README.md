### Timeline

Start Date: 15-09-2021

Finish Date: 20-09-2021

Hours Spent: 14


### Running the Program

Main class: Main

Data files needed: None added from the default file

Key/Mouse inputs: Both Key and mouse inputs are used for this project. Specified in innerClass LinkListener.

Known Bugs: I have reached over 75% with Model and ModelTest. However, I all my tests for View creates an error. 
I think there is a difference with JavaFx that makes testing different. 


### Notes/Assumptions
I have used the code from the lab. Although most of the code are changed, some code may still have similarities with 
Jordan Castleman

### Impressions
I have enjoyed working on the browser assignment. I have learned a lot of front end skills that could be used in later
group projects. Also, I was able to practice how to implement tests.
